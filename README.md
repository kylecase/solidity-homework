# solidity-homework

## Purpose
Created a Solidity smart contract for exchanging funds between two accounts

## Processes
- Defined the smart contract logic using Solidity
- Compiled the Solidity code using Remix
- Deployed the smart contract using a JavaScript VM on Remix
- Tested the smart contract by performing actions (see screen shots)

## Result
The smart contract is able to perform all the requirements that were defined.

## Summary
This module provided an introduction to building smart contracts and easily perform transactions with Solidity
